# pdf-crawler

An automated PDF accessibility crawler and analyser built on
[simplA11yPDFCrawler](https://github.com/accessibility-luxembourg/simplA11yPDFCrawler)
and deployable entirely on GitHub Pages + GitHub Actions – no server needed.

---

## What it does

1. **Crawls** a website for PDF (and other document) files using
   [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org).
2. **Maintains a YAML manifest** (`reports/manifest.yaml`) with every
   discovered file's URL, MD5 hash, and accessibility results.  Files whose
   MD5 hash has not changed since the last run are **skipped** automatically.
3. **Analyses** each pending PDF for the following accessibility issues
   (based on WCAG 2.x / EN 301 549):

   | Check | WCAG SC | Description |
   |-------|---------|-------------|
   | `TaggedTest` | – | Is the document tagged? |
   | `EmptyTextTest` | 1.4.5 | Does it contain real text (not just images)? |
   | `ProtectedTest` | – | Is it protected against assistive technologies? |
   | `TitleTest` | 2.4.2 | Does it have a title with `DisplayDocTitle` set? |
   | `LanguageTest` | 3.1.1 | Does it have a valid default language? |
   | `BookmarksTest` | 2.4.1 | For documents > 20 pages, does it have bookmarks? |

4. **Generates reports** in Markdown and JSON.
5. **Deletes the PDF files** after analysis to keep the repository small;
   only the YAML manifest is committed.

## Quick start

### 1 – Submit a crawl via the web form

Open the [PDF Crawler form](https://mgifford.github.io/pdf-crawler/#quick-start),
enter a URL, and click **Submit Crawl Request**.  You will be taken to GitHub
with the issue title pre-filled as `SCAN: https://…` — just click
*Submit new issue* to start the crawl.

The `SCAN:` prefix triggers the *Crawl Site for PDFs* workflow automatically.
The workflow will post a comment when the crawl starts and another comment with
the full accessibility report links when analysis is complete.

> **Note:** Issues are only processed once when **opened**.  Editing the issue
> body will not re-trigger a scan, so there is no risk of accidental recurring
> scans.  The legacy `PDF-CRAWL:` prefix is still accepted for backward
> compatibility.

### 2 – Submit a crawl manually

[Open a new issue](https://github.com/mgifford/pdf-crawler/issues/new)
and set the title to:

```
SCAN: https://example.com
```

### 3 – Trigger manually

Go to **Actions → 1 – Crawl Site for PDFs → Run workflow** and enter the URL
you want to crawl.

Once the crawl finishes, the *2 – Analyse PDFs for Accessibility* workflow
starts automatically.  You can also trigger it manually.

## Workflows

| Workflow | File | Trigger |
|----------|------|---------|
| Crawl Site for PDFs | `.github/workflows/crawl.yml` | Manual dispatch or issue opened with `SCAN:` title (legacy: `PDF-CRAWL:`) |
| Analyse PDFs for Accessibility | `.github/workflows/analyse.yml` | After crawl succeeds, or manual dispatch |

---

## Output files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `reports/manifest.yaml` | YAML tracking file – one entry per PDF |
| `reports/report.md` | Human-readable Markdown report |
| `reports/report.json` | Machine-readable JSON report |

See [`reports/README.md`](reports/README.md) for the full manifest schema.
